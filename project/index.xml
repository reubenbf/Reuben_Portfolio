      <title>Data-Driven Music Activity Analysis</title>

      <description>The project explores personal music activity, using Last.fm, a website that builds a detailed profile of each user&amp;rsquo;s musical taste by recording details of the tracks heard by the user and RateYourMusic a collaborative music database used to catalog and rate music (and films). The former however has a &amp;lsquo;Report&amp;rsquo; section that does statistically create reports for past week and year but is quite limited. We use the liberty of having the overall archival data of both the websites to have the ability to visualize overall, yearly, monthly, weekly or even daily stats for artists, their albums, ratings per album or even play counts and various other combinations.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility Project: Simple Scenery Image Classification and Neural Style Transfer</title>

      <description>We look at original works (Image Classification using Conventional models and Neural Style Transfer) and prove it&amp;rsquo;s reprodicibiity by replicating them. we first create a few conventional models to classify a certain dataset, secondly create a neural style transfer model that stylestically change an image from the same dataset and finally compare these images back to the conventional models to notice if the model can still classify them correctly
Dataset We use the “8 Scene Categories Dataset” taken from Aude Oliva, Antonio Torralba’s study] that contains eight outdoor scene categories: coast, mountain, forest, open country, street, inside city, tall buildings and highways.</description>
