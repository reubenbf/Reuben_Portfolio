      <description>üé® Hugely inspired by roboflow-ai and The AI Guy
 üìù Prerequisites  Preprocess your labelled dataset for free on roboflow it&amp;rsquo;s easier. Downloading pre-trained weights for faster training ‚è© Time ‚è≤, your models can take quite some time to train, get a snack, or some sleep while it&amp;rsquo;s at it.  Image Annotation Optionally, you can use LabelImg to label your images from scratch.
üëÄ Usage Just follow the steps mentioned in the notebook and get started üò¨.</description>

      <description>üìå‚ú® For more pinned-gist projects like this one, check out: https://github.com/matchai/awesome-pinned-gists
  Project hugely inspired by https://github.com/RangerDigital/neko-box
  NowPlay-Box is a simple GitHub Action built to make dynamic Gist displaying the album you&amp;rsquo;re now-playing on Spotify .
 Usage To start, you need to prepare some things:
  Create a new public GitHub Gist at https://gist.github.com/
  Create an Access Token with the gist scope and save it.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Music Activity Analysis</title>

      <description>The project explores personal music activity, using Last.fm, a website that builds a detailed profile of each user&amp;rsquo;s musical taste by recording details of the tracks heard by the user and RateYourMusic a collaborative music database used to catalog and rate music (and films). The former however has a &amp;lsquo;Report&amp;rsquo; section that does statistically create reports for past week and year but is quite limited. We use the liberty of having the overall archival data of both the websites to have the ability to visualize overall, yearly, monthly, weekly or even daily stats for artists, their albums, ratings per album or even play counts and various other combinations.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility Project: Simple Scenery Image Classification and Neural Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://reubenbf.github.io/project/project-2/</link>

      <description>We look at original works (Image Classification using Conventional models and Neural Style Transfer) and prove it&amp;rsquo;s reprodicibiity by replicating them. we first create a few conventional models to classify a certain dataset, secondly create a neural style transfer model that stylestically change an image from the same dataset and finally compare these images back to the conventional models to notice if the model can still classify them correctly
Dataset We use the ‚Äú8 Scene Categories Dataset‚Äù taken from Aude Oliva, Antonio Torralba‚Äôs study] that contains eight outdoor scene categories: coast, mountain, forest, open country, street, inside city, tall buildings and highways.</description>
